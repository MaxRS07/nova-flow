# NovaFlow

NovaFlow is a web-based hub for creating, managing, and reusing Nova Act workflows. It lets developers compose modular agent pipelines, parameterize them, and run or modify existing workflows without starting from scratch. 

Built with Next.js + typescript, Supabase, nova-act Python SDK, and AWS agents.

## Why NovaFlow?

NovaFlow is built specifically with users in mind, no technical experience required. Users can go straight from idea to execution using the in app multi-agent workflow.
