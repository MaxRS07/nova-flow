# NovaFlow

NovaFlow is a web-based hub for creating, managing, and reusing Nova Act workflows. It lets developers compose modular agent pipelines, parameterize them, and run or modify existing workflows without starting from scratch. 

Built with Next.js + typescript, Supabase, nova-act Python SDK, and AWS agents.
